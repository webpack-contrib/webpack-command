# webpack-command

üî≥ A proof-of-concept for a lightweight, modular, and opinionated webpack CLI.

For users coming from `webpack-cli`, please read about
[the differences](#differences-with-webpack-cli) between this module and
`webpack-cli`.

## Requirements

This module requires a minimum of Node v6.14.0 and Webpack v4.0.0.

`webpack-command` and `webpack-cli` cannot be installed at the same time, as
they both export a bin file named `webpack`. When trying `webpack-command`,
please `npm uninstall webpack-cli` first.

## Benefits

`webpack-command` has many advantages over other CLI experiences for `webpack`.
These include:

- A full test suite with 190 tests and 95% coverage (so close to 100% üí™)
- A 93% smaller package cost versus `webpack-cli`
- Highly focused on the User Experience and detail
- Validation of commands, entries, and flags before further execution
- Extensible third-party commands. Include only what you need!
- A beautiful default user experience with output driven by
[`webpack-stylish`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-stylish)
- Custom Reporters ü§Ø
- Support for `webpack` configuration in any language or compiler that provides
a `require` hook
- Support for `webpack` configuration in `JSON`, `YAML`, or `JavaScript`

And last, but not least, Did-You-Mean suggestions for flags:

## Commands

`webpack-command` allows users to extend the `webpack` CLI experience by
including a few helpful built-in commands, and providing a means to develop
third-party commands.

### Built-In Commands

- [Help Command](docs/HelpCommand.md)
- [Teach Command](docs/TeachCommand.md)

## Flags

For more documentation on flags, please see the
[`webpack-cli` documentation](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/).

## Differences With `webpack-cli`

While this project aims for parity with `webpack-cli` in nearly all aspects,
there are some notable differences. Included in those differences is the note
that this module includes the bare minimum of commands to provide a `webpack`
CLI. Commands like `init`, `migrate`, and `update` are relegated to separate,
user-installed modules.

That said, the following differences should also be noted:

### The `--env` Flag is Nuked

[Environment Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) have
been around a very, very long time. `webpack-cli` chose to introduce a feature
that let users specify environment variables via a flag. This module does not
include that feature. Instead, users should make use of environment variables
the traditional, standard way:

`$ NEAT_VAR=woo webpack ...`

And access the values via `process.env`. Alternatively, if users are in need of
cross-platform environment variables, a tool such as
[`cross-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env) should be leveraged.

### Key=Value Pairs

Certain flags passed in `webpack-cli` allow for a key-value pair for
pairing an alias with the alias value. e.g. `--entry name=file`. This module
adopts a CLI-standard approach by using the syntax `--flag.key value` instead,
and does not support the `key=value` syntax.

### Entries

Specifying entries by either flag (`--flag`) or input (`webpack <file>`) require
that the file or directory specified exist.

Entries passed with a comma-separated value `--entry file,file2` are deprecated
and should be migrated to use the CLI-standard `--entry file --entry file2`
syntax.

Entries passed by flag in `webpack-cli` using `--entry name=file` should be
migrated to use the `--entry.name file` syntax.

### Resolve Alias

Resolve aliases passed by flag in `webpack-cli` using
`--resolve-alias alias=value` should be migrated to use the `--resolve-alias.{alias} {value}`
syntax.

### Resolve Loader Alias

Resolve aliases passed by flag in `webpack-cli` using
`--resolve-loader-alias alias=value` should be migrated to use the
`--resolve-loader-alias.alias value` syntax.

## Reporters

`webpack-command` supports custom, user-defined reporters which allow users
full control over how build data is presented. By default, it ships with two
available reporters:

#### `basic`

Displays the default `webpack` output, the same you'll see
using `webpack-cli`.

#### `stylish`

The **default** reporter and displays beautiful output using the same code
that drives [`webpack-stylish`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-stylish).

Building your own reporter is as easy as inheriting from the `Reporter` class
located at `lib/reporters/Reporter.js`.

## Configuration Languages and Compilers

`webpack-command` allows users to leverage any language that provides a require
hook. To leverage this feature, define your configs as such for the following
languages/compilers:

- Babel ES6 Modules: `webpack.config.js` or `webpack.config.es6`, and use
`--require babel-register`
- Flow: `webpack.config.js` or `webpack.config.flow`, and use
`--require flow-remove-types/register`
- TypeScript: `webpack.config.ts`, and use `--require ts-node/register`

Other hooks may work for additional language or compiler support.

_Note: Compilers are not part of, nor built-into this module. To use a specific
compiler, you must install it first._

## Gotchas

Any entry files specified will overwrite entries in a `webpack.config.js` file
as of [this Pull Request](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/pull/358) in
`webpack-cli`.
